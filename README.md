## Acknowledgements
I heavily referenced the course homework for this code

## Javascript Code
The code starts off loading the earthquake data and console logging it to ensure it loads correctly. Next I create the "creatMap" function adding the tile layer, base map, overlay map, and map object. 

Next I create the "createMarkers" function to load the coordinates of each earthquake and format the size and color of the circle marker to correspond to the magnitude and depth of each earthquake.
